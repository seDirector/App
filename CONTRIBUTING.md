# Ways to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to seDirector, we have several volunteer opportunities available:

-   Translations
    -   Although nowadays we can use AI to translate the application, it's not always accurate. Apart from making sure the translations are accurate, we also need to make sure the translations are not too long for the UI elements, and that they make sense in the context of the application.
    -   **We are currently looking for translators for *specific* languages, and *new* languages are being added to a waitlist.** Please see more information on the [Translations](https://sedirector.net/translate) page.
-   Beta Testing
    -   **We are not looking for additional beta testers at this time.** All slots are currently filled for beta testing.** We will make an announcement when the program open its applications again.
-   Code Contributions
    -   Lately we have been working on a web control panel that works with the seDirector API on the background to provide a web interface for managing seDirector. Take a look at the [Control-Panel](https://github.com/seDirector/Control-Panel) repo. It is in the very early stages of development.
-   Bug Reports
    -   If you find a bug, please report it on our [Issues](https://github.com/seDirector/App/issues) page. If you are unsure if it's a bug, please ask on our [Discord](https://sedirector.net/discord) first.
-   Discussion / Ideas / Feature Requests
    -   This one is our favorite â€” ideas! If you have an idea you'd like to discuss, head on over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/seDirector/App/discussions) area of the repo and/or our [Discord](https://sedirector.net/discord) server.

# Contributor Benefits & License

-   All contributors who provide a _significant_ amount of data to seDirector will be granted a complimentary Contributor license, which has the same features as the Pro license. This means you will have access to all features of [seDirector](https://github.com/seDirector/App/wiki/Pro-Edition).
-   Applicable contributors include those who translate seDirector, perform in-depth beta testing, or contribute to the codebase. The contributions must be significant enough to warrant a license. Generally that means 1+ hours of time, determined by the mods.
-   Contributors _must_ remain active and participating with seDirector, on Discord and on GitHub. If no contributions have been made in over 2 months, even though the mods have requested translations, testing, or other assistance, your account may revert back to the free license. This is in order to ensure that the project remains active and contributors are participating. You can always purchase a Pro license if you wish to continue using the Pro features.
-   Your username will be mentioned in seDirector, on the `Help > About` screen under the `Contributors` section.
-   When you contribute to seDirector, you grant a license to seDirector to use your contribution in any way it chooses, including modifying and redistributing it under the seDirector project license. You also grant seDirector a license to use your GitHub username for the purpose of giving you credit for your contribution (optional if requested). seDirector reserves the right to revoke contributor licenses at any time for any reason. If you have any questions, please ask on Discord.
